1. Data
1.1 Storage Infrastructure
All data are stored in a common data storage infrastructure.
The data storage infrastructure applies versioning (e.g. track revisions, track change authors, retrieve revisions by time stamp) to all data.
[TODO] Other cross-cutting data storage features: private / official; permissions; subscription (live data); production / testing environment segregation.

1.2 Structure
The data are organised in data sets. A data set can contain other data sets. The leave nodes of this tree structure can have many different structures: a single table, a set of related relational database tables, several sets of related relational database tables, variously sructured sets of XML or JSON data, variously structured sets of data blobs, etc.

1.2.1 Booking Data
Booking data are the data involved in representing the business’s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which are typically claims and commitments governed by contractual relationships with other financial institutions. 

1.2.1.1 Counterparties
A table of counterparty data (e.g. Name, Country, Legal Entity Identifier) keyed by CounterpartyId.
The counterparties may be internal or external.
Transactions typically involve an internal counterparty entering a financial contract with an external counterparty. Some transactions are between internal counterparties.

1.2.1.2 CSA Agreements
CSA agreements have complex and varied structures. This data set aims to capture in a structured way all data relevant to the automatic management of the collateral flows stipulated by the agreement. The same data are relevant to CSA-aware valuations.
Contains a master table of CSA agreement data (e.g. OurCounterpartyId, TheirCounterpartyId, PdfImage) keyed by CsaAgreementId.

1.2.1.3 Books, Lines and Instruments
Books are containers of lines and other books.
A line represents an asset, liability or off-balance-sheet item of the business. 
An instrument represents the form of an asset, liability or off-balance sheet item: cash, a security, a loan, a structured note, an OTC derivative contract, etc.
The data of a line consist of:
* a LineId unique identifier
* the BookId of the book which contains the line
* the InstrumentId of the instrument which the line consists of
* the quantity of the instrument
* OurCounterpartyId, the identifier of the internal counterparty to which the asset, liability or off-balance-sheet item belongs [other option: make this a book-level property] 
* TheirCounterpartyId, the identifier of the external counterparty on the other side of the asset, liability or off-balance-sheet item, if applicable.
* A PDF image of the documentation / confirmation of the transaction leading to the creation of the line, if applicable.

For example, we can consider these InstrumentIds:
1	USD cash
2	5Y USD LIBOR swap with start date 1-July-2015 (receive 2% fixed, unit notional)
3	Alphabet Inc. Class A Common Stock, ISIN US02079K3059

We could have these lines in a given book:
LineId	BookId	InstrumentId	Quantity	OurCpId	TheirCpId
12345	1	1		1,000,000	123	NULL
42424	1	2		-1,000,000	234	4242
42425	1	2		1,000,000	234	2213
98989	1	3		10,000		234	NULL

[In this example, USD cash or common stock are booked with a NULL TheirCpId. They represent vault cash or physical shares. If such assets are in the hands of a counterparty, whether internal (treasury) or external (custodian), the corresponding lines will have slightly different instruments and non-null TheirCpIds.]

Each Book has a business owner.
The data of the Lines and Books contained in a Book refer to the BookId of the containing Book. It is never the reverse, i.e. not the data of a containing Book which refer to the LineIds and BookIds of the Lines and Books it contains. This ensures that every Line belongs to exactly one Book and every Book to at most one Book.

The Instrument data can take as many forms as the business's assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items. The data of an Instrument consist of:
* an InstrumentId unique identifier
* an InstrumentTypeId, referring to a data set collecting and organising all the possible instrument types: the Instrument Taxonomy.
* further data, according to a schema specified for the instrument type of the instrument; for example, ISO code for cash; ISIN for common stock; cash flow dates, index reference, fixed rate for an interest rate swap; etc.

1.2.1.4 Transaction Life Cycle Data
This data set contains data relating to all the financial events having effectively occurred in relation to a given line. 
Primarily, every line has an inception date-time, indicating when an asset, liability or off-balance-sheet item started belonging to the internal counterparty. Because of booking delays and booking errors, the inception date-time may be different from the date-time at which the line was created.
Likewise, every line has an optional termination date-time, indicating when the line ceases to belong to the internal counterparty. For example, if cash is transferred to another book, if an interest rate swap expires, or is terminated early by mutual agreement, if common stock is sold, if a swaption is exercised, a termination date-time will be booked against the corresponding lines.
Besides these general properties, transaction life cycle data keep track of events like:
* the execution of cash flows and other asset flows required by the contract, whether received or paid (including e.g. dividend flows, physical settlement of a swaption)
* when the contract is subject to margin mechanisms, the execution of the margin cash flows
* the notification of decisions when the contract contains options, whether received or emitted
* the breach of a barrier for derivatives having a barrier feature
Events like reference index fixings, credit events, dividend declarations, are not part of the transaction life cycle data, because they exist independently of any given line. They are retrieved from the market data when needed. [An alternative architecture to consider: such events are booked against the corresponding lines by a market monitor service as they arise.]

1.2.2 Market Data
This data set contains all data involved in the representation of the financial markets. The things represented by these data are inherently common to the market participants. 

1.2.2.1 Market Prices
E.g. security prices, FX spot rates.

1.2.2.2 Market Models
E.g. interest rate curves, equity volatility surfaces.

1.2.2.3 Reference Values
Administered benchmark indices (e.g. FX spot fixings, interest rate fixings, proprietary indices).
Other public reference values (e.g. dividend amounts, credit event auction settlement prices).

1.2.2.4 Market Events
E.g. credit events, dividend declarations.

1.2.2.5 Market Conventions
E.g. day count conventions and other calculation rules associated with interest rate indices, spot day conventions of the FX market.


1.2.3 Analytics Data
This data set contains all data generated by the analytics systems. They give quantitative insights into the financial position of the business.

1.2.3.1 Book Analytics
Book analytics contains data generated by the Analytics Engine, whether line analytics (such as the MTM of an individual line, the deltas and vegas of an individual line) or portofolio analytics (such as the XVA of an individual portfolio, the deltas and vegas of the XVA of an individual portfolio), as well the same analytics subject to specified scenarios.

They are organised in a table structure having these columns:
* BookAnalyticsId (unique identifier)
* RunId refers to the Analytics Engine run which generated the analytics. It can be used to retrieve information such as the date-time and the market data used from an auxiliary table (Runs).
* Either LineId or PortfolioId is populated, and the other is null, depending on the analytic being a line or portfolio analytic.
* MeasureId refers to e.g.: MTM of perfectly collateralised derivative; MTM+FVA of uncollateralised derivative; XVA of a portfolio, etc. Measures are defined in the businnes configuration data. The result of a measure is usually a unique floating value.
* RiskMetricId and RiskMetricBucket are optional. RiskMetricId refers to a risk metric operating on the measure. E.g.: interest rate delta, equity vega. Risk metrics are defined in the business configuration data. Risk metrics frequently generate multiple floating values. When it is the case, these values are indexed by RiskMetricBucket.
* ScenarioId and ScenarioBucket are optional. ScenarioId refers to a scenario applying to the measure and the risk metric, i.e. a specified set of changes applied to the normal input values of the analytics. The input value changes typically apply to the market data, but sometimes to business configuration data (e.g. model parameter scenario) or booking data (e.g. trade parameter scenario). Scenarios frequently define multiple scenario points. When it is the case, the scenario points are indexed by ScenarioBucket.
* Value is the result of applying the measure, risk metric and scenario to the line or portfolio. Some special measures do not produce a single floating value (e.g. the "optimal exercise decision" measure produces a single Boolean; the "European option values" measure produces a strip of floating values). For such measures, Value is null and the actual value is stored, keyed by BookAnalyticsId, in one of the Booking Analytics Auxiliary Structures.

1.2.3.2 Book Analytics Auxiliary Structures
There is one such structure for each measure producing outputs in another form than a single float value. Examples of such measures are: Optimal Exercise Decision; European Option Values (the value of each European swaption embedded in a Bermudan swaption); Expected Future Flows. The values stored in these structures are keyed by BookAnalyticsId, so they can be combined with the Book Analytics table to obtain the same meta-data (RunId, LineId/PortfolioId, MeasureId, RiskMetricId and RiskMetricBucket, ScenarioId and ScenarioBucket) as for float-value-producing measures.

1.2.3.3 P/L Explains
These data contain the results generated by the P/L Explain Engine. In general, the P/L Explain Engine attributes the change of a measure (e.g. MTM) for a specific line or portfolio to a number of additive components (e.g. IR order 1, IR vol order 1, IR order 2, IR vol order 2, IR Vol cross). The structure of the table is:
* ExplainId (unique identifier)
* RunId refers to the P/L Explain Engine run which generated the analytics. It can be used to retrieve information such as the the date-time of the initial and final measure values and the other analytics data used as input.
* LineId/PortfolioId indicate the line or portfolio for which the measure change is explained.
* MeasureId indicates the measure whose value change is explained.
* ExplainComponentId indicates a specific explain component, e.g. IR vol order 1, or the initial or final MTM value. ExplainComponentIds are defined in the P/L Explain Configuration data.


1.2.4 Business Configuration Data
We distinguish business configuration data from technical configuration data. Both contain the specification of the free parameters of the system implementation. The former are typically relevant to end users, e.g. trading, middle office, risk. The latter are typically relevant to system implementors and maintainers, e.g. IT, quants.

1.2.4.1 Measure Definitions, Risk Metric Definitions and Scenario Definitions
These data sets contain the definitions corresponding to MeasureId, RiskMetricId and ScenarioId, whose role is described in the Book Analytics section.
Each of MeasureId, RiskMetricId and ScenarioId is a unique identifier within its data set.

Each measure has a name, taken from the Measure enumeration. Other data depend on the exact measure. For example, MTM may have a field specifying the funding assumption (SCSA, SCSA-Libor, with FVA).

Each RiskMetric has a name, taken from the RiskMetric enumeration, which specifies the type of risk metric, e.g. IrDelta, IrVega, EquityDelta, EquityVega, etc. Other data depend on the exact measure. For example, IrDelta has an InstrumentSet field specifying the instrument set onto which the IR curve risk is projected. Risk metric definitions do not contain calculation method indications such as: automatic differentiation/finite difference, difference size (for finite difference), etc. These belong in the model configuration data.

Each Scenario has a name, taken from the Scenario enumeration, e.g. IrNormalVolShock. The data contain a specification of the scenario points and the mutations applied at each scenario point.
[Scenario classification is an interesting topic of business configuration. The challenge is to achieve the right balance of flexibility and order. Flexibility is easy (free-form strings) but results in a messy organisation. Order is doable by reviewing and organising all existing scenarios, but a too naïve approach would not persist in time. This requires a good understanding of the business needs of big scenario consumers: trading, risk.]

1.2.4.2 Model Configuration
Whenever the analytics specified by a measure, a risk metric, or a scenario, require user choice of the calculation method, these choices are encapsulated in the Model Configuration data set.
E.g. the MTM measure may require very sophisticated valuation model specifications for products like interest rate exotics (value with LMM or short rate model; use a Monte-Carlo or PDE algorithm; detailed parameterisation of the LMM or short rate model).
Likewise, the IrDelta risk metric may require AD or FD, and different bump sizes in the case of FD, depending on the product.
Likewise, an IR vol scenario specified in terms of normal vol changes may leave room for user parameterisation of how they are translated to the SABR alpha space.
[Come back to this section and detail the data structures after detailing the Analytics Engine architecture.]

1.2.4.3 P/L Explain Configuration
This data set contains the definitions of the ExplainComponentIds, including in particular their names, taken from ExplainComponent enumeration, e.g. InterestRate_FirstOrder, InterestRate_InterestRateVol_SecondOrder, OriginalValue, NewValue, Residual.
It also specifies P/L explain methodologies, in particular a selection of explain components to be included. These are used by the P/L explain engine.

1.2.4.4 Portfolio Definitions
Portfolios are sets of lines. Books are simple examples of portfolios but one may need to group lines into portfolios using other criteria than the book the lines belong to. For example, in the context of XVA and credit exposure analytics, one may have to consider the portfolio of all trades within a netting group with a given counterparty.
This data set contains PortfolioId unique identifiers and rules for generating the list of LineIds forming a given portfolio.
In general, analytics can be divided into line analytics and portfolio analytics. The former (e.g. MTM under perfect collateralisation) are keyed by LineId and the latter (e.g. CVA, PFE, ES) are keyed by PortfolioId.


1.2.5 Business Control Data
These are data relating to the business controls, such as monitoring conformance with trading mandates and defining and monitoring conformance with market risk limits.

1.2.5.1 Trading Mandate Data
These are the data required to control that the booking data are consistent with the trading mandate, e.g. that all lines in a book belong to a pre-determined set of allowed instrument types.

1.2.5.2 Market Risk Limits
These are the data indicating the risk limits set by the market risk team in terms of maximal risk for a given book and a given risk metric.


1.2.6 Technical Configuration Data
This data set contains configuration relating to the technologies used for system implementation. E.g. it may hold rules determining if a compute load is routed to an internal computation grid or to an external cloud.
It also contains all application configuration data which do not belong with business configuration data, e.g. user-customised GUI layouts.


1.2.7 Infrastructure Data
Infrastructure Data are low-level data shared by the whole system.

1.2.7.1 Enumerations
Enumerations are exactly like C++ scoped enums. Each enumeration defines a correspondence between integers and human-readable identifiers. The correspondence is relative to a given enumeration. All enum values must be stored as integers and interpreted to a human-readable identifier only when presenting data to a human. This enables the human-readable identifiers to be changed (and errors corrected) much more easily. This mechanism minimises the presence of free-form strings in the systems while enabling human-friendly interfaces.

Example table structure: 
Enumeration		Enumerator		Value
Measure			MarkToMarket		0
Measure			CreditValueAdjustment	1
Measure			FundingValueAdjustment	2
RiskMetric		IrDelta			0
RiskMetric		EquityVega		1
RiskMetric		FxDelta			2
Scenario		IrNormalVol		0
Scenario		InternalStressTest	1
ExplainComponent	InterestRate_FirstOrder	0
ExplainComponent	InterestRate_InterestRateVol_SecondOrder	1
ExplainComponent	OriginalValue		2
ExplainComponent	NewValue		3
ExplainComponent	Residual		4


1.2.7.2 Execution Log
Application and service subsystems log their activity in the execution log.
The excution log may contain information such as error messages, calibration diagnostics, but not information required for the normal operation of the business.



2. Applications
2.1 Booking Applications
2.1.1 Counterparty Manager
Create, edit and explore Counterparties and CSA Agreement data.

2.1.2 Book and Portfolio Manager
Create, edit and explore Book data (e.g. organise book hierarchies, assign owners to books, define permissions for adding, removing and changing lines belonging to a book, etc.).
Create, edit and explore Portfolio Definitions.

2.1.3 Transaction Editor
Create, edit and explore line and instrument data. E.g. when a trader transacts an IR swap  with an external counterparty, they or a booking assistant may use the Transaction Editor to create a corresponding instrument and a corresponding line in the adequate book. This application must contain a large number of booking templates, reflecting all the possible instrument types.
A careful design of the instrument taxonomy and of the instrument description language are essential to keeping this application lean and consistent.

2.1.4 Transaction Life Cycle Manager
Record line-related life cycle events such as inception, termination, paid and received cash flows and other asset flows.

2.2 Market Data Applications
2.2.1 Market Data Publisher
Create, edit and explore market data. Some subsystems of this application are automated services (e.g. automatic publication of market data from external sources). For other market data, though, there is user interaction. E.g. volatility surfaces may require a user interface where markers of market data can enter inputs to the market model calibration, run the calibration, review and edit the calibrated model, publish the model.

2.2.2 Market Data Scenario Editor
Create, edit and explore market data scenario definitions. In particular, this application enables users to inspect the effect of the scenario specification on real market data.

2.3 Analytics Applications
2.3.1 Analytics Engine
This application drives the calculation of line and portfolio analytics. 
The inputs of such calculations are booking data, market data, model configuration data and measure, metric and scenario specifications. The specification of these inputs froms a fairly complex structure, known as a Run Definition.
The application enables the user to create, edit and explore run definitions and to execute run definitions. The generated analytics are stored in the Analytics Data set.

2.3.2 Analytics Data Explorer
This application enables the user to explore the data available in the Analytics Data. 
It offers generic database exploration tools.
It can present the data to the user in formats specific to the data being displayed. For example, it is in the presentation layer of the Analytics Data Explorer that the interest risk buckets are labeled with meaningful risk instrument identifiers (e.g. EURIBOR 5Y, 7Y, 10Y swap rate).

2.3.3 Integrated Trading Environment
The primary function of this application is, like the Analytics Engine, to drive the calculation of line and portfolio analytics. However, it supports much more in-depth customisation of the inputs. 
For example, where the Analytics Engine specifies the booking data by reference to the data store, the Integrated Trading Engine contains a module where  booking data (most importantly, instrument definitions) can be created and edited by the user within the application. They can also be loaded from the data store, edited, and saved back.
The same is true about market data and business configuration data.
The calculation of the analytics uses the same components as the Analytics Engine and the results are stored in the Analytics Data.
The exploration of the calculation results can be done with the Analytics Data Explorer or  in an integrated module of the Integrated Trading Environment.
Functionalities specific to the salespeople's, traders' and middle office's activitiesare implemented in the Integrated Trading Environment, e.g. mandatory client scenarios, exercise decision recommendation, hedging recommendation, inspecting valuation model diagnoses, generated expected cash flow diagnosis.

2.3.4 P/L Explain Engine
This application drives the calculuation of P/L Explains, i.e. a breakdown of the change of a line-level or portfolio-level measure analytic into additive components.
The breakdown can be accomplished in many different ways.
Using the P/L Explain Engine, the user can select a portfolio and P/L Engine Configuration and execute the corresponding calculation. The results are written into the Analytics Data.

2.3.5 Potfolio Analytics Attribution Engine
This application specifies and drives the calculation of Portfolio Analytics Attributions, i.e. the breakdown of a portofolio analytic such as CVA or RWA into additive components assigned to subcomponents of the portfolio, e.g. individual lines.

2.4 Infrastructure Applications
2.4.1 Execution Log Explorer
Explore the contents of the execution log. Filter by application, RunId, LineId, PortfolioId, etc.

2.4.2 Unified Scripting Environment
All applications, and many of the services of which they are composed, offer a scripting interface with at least the same execution capabilities as the graphical user interface. The Unified Scripting Environment is a command-line environment from which these scripting interfaces are accessed. It defines a shared language (e.g. Python 3), a shared feel (e.g. JSON config files, Linux-style command-line options), shared utilities.

2.4.3 Task Scheduler
This application enables users (most importantly, the team responsible for the ongoing performance of the books-and-records processes) to define and execute recurring execution flows, with dependencies, alerts, etc.

2.4.4 System Configurator
A common graphical user interface for the exploration and edition of business configuration data, business control data, technical configuration data. A good analogy would be the preferences panels of MacOS, Windows, iOS, Android. They offer a good deal of consistency and shared functionalities, as well as flexibility for more customised configuration GUIs.


2.5 Business Control Applications
2.5.1 Trading Mandate Monitor
Continuous monitoring that the booking data conform with the trading mandate data. GUI for users to explore and review status, breaches, etc.

2.5.2 Market Risk Monitor
Continuous monitoring that the market risk analytics are within the defined market risk limits. GUI for users to explore and review status, breaches, set customised alerts, etc.
